This is the next prompt of the previous one.
ALWAYS GROUND RESOURCES/PAPERS TO THE OUTPUT.
BE REALLY CAREFUL OF SKIPPING THE CHECKING PROCESS.
EVEN IF IT'S TEDIOUS, JUST DO IT MANUALLY.
In the thinking process, DO NOT just write out answers.
Describe each process REALLY firmly.
Just writing out the answers will be punished strictly.

THIS IS THE PROOFREADING PART. YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS.
In the proofreading part, you must do these:
1. ALWAYS CHECK FOR HALLUCINATION. GROUND PAPERS/REASONS.
2. DO NOT just give "Yes, seems correct.". This is NOT ALLOWED.
3. You must state like this, and create script for the debate: "Opposition: No, that's not correct."
4. Then refute to the opinion.
5. If needed, further continue this debate until the answer is completely made sure that is correct.
